# 1769-KJV

I don't know if github is going to let me put the images here, but if they do, these are images of a so-called 1769 "second issue" King James bible that was published in 1772. It's the folio and it's quite rare. I wanted it to be that anybody could see these images without paying for it. I need to do some image processing and make a nice PDF. I'll probably have to write some code to do that, and if so, it will go here. But once that's done I'll probably put the processed images and the PDF on archive.org.
