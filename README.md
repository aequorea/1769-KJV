# 1769-KJV

These are images of a so-called "second issue" of the 1769 King James Bible that was published in 1772. As far as I can tell, it's an exact match to Blayney's "first issue" published in 1769. It's the folio and it's quite rare.

These are raw images and not super convenient to view. For something easier to look at head on over to archive.org and get a PDF:
